        Here's to the crazy ones. <br>
        The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.<br>
        The round pegs in the square holes.<br>
        The ones who see things differently.<br> 
        They're not fond of rules.<br> 
        And they have no respect for the status quo. <br>
        You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.<br>
        About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.<br> 
        Because they change things.<br> 
        They push the human race forward.<br> 
        And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.<br> 
        Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.
